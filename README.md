Please see page.tsx, or its deployed version, for usage information and an explanantion of how this app works.

Other Technical Details

- Basic player data is pulled directly from Enka.Network without the use of any wrapper.
- The loc (localization) and character files have already been processed into the JSON weights file.

Future Plans

- Breakdown calc like
  2.5 CR + 0.8 CDMG + 1.5 ATK% + 0.8 ATK -> 2.5*3 + 0.8*3 + 1.5\*1.5
- Add ER target and valuation
- Add Enka data TTL check, or some cache lifespan
- Improve background
- Alternating color for weights table rows
- Link to Enka for specified UID
- Pull saved builds from Enka account
  - Add extra weights entry for saved builds
  - Show team, rotation details / Enka build name
- Group characters by artifact set and domain
- Display table of off-set pieces
- Use total Er needed and factor in character ascension+weapon+ER time
