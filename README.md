This app finds the value of an artifact compared to an artifact with max rolls and perfect substats. It uses an editable weights table which which is a set of percentages showing how much a max roll substat has/will increase a character's total damage.
See the page file or the live web-page for usage information.

Basic player data is pulled directly from Enka.Network without the use of any wrapper.

The loc (localization) and character files are not needed here since the data has already been processed into JSON weights file.

Future Plans

- Add TTL check, or some cache lifespan
- Improve background
- Add footer with GitHub link
- Alternating color weights table rows
- Break down calculation on hover
- Link to Enka for specified UID
- Pull saved builds from Enka account
- Add extra weights entry for saved builds
- Show team, rotation details / saved to Enka build name
- Group characters by artifact set and domain
- Display table of off-set pieces
